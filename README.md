# DiabetesT2
The project is based on a study of the prediction of type 2 diabetes. The study is possible thanks to data from the **E3N-E4N** databases. The data will be studied using statistical methods and
machine learning methods This project is part of a desire to develop tools to predict the onset of diabetes in patients and the date when diabetes
will manifest. First, a predictive model for diabetes classification was set up . Using this model, the influence of patients dier on the onset of diabetes could be studied. On the other hand, a
prediction technique using the decision tree method was explored. Finally, a survival algorithm predicts the age on which diabetes will appear and analyse the risk timewise.
